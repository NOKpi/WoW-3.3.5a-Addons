# Most Useful WoW Addons for Patch 3.3.5a WotLK

**This is my AddonRepository for WotLK. (Created by NoM0Re)**<br/>I have written this Repository to download the newest Addons for the WotLK Patch.<br/>
Not every Addon is compatible with other Addons. (It is written in the Title)<br/><br/>
**The Repository will be Updated every few Months to the newest Build of the Addons**, if something changed.<br/><br/>
Also I posted the [sources](https://github.com/NoM0Re/Addons/blob/main/README.md#most-useful-wow-addons-for-patch-335a-wotlk) where i got the addons.
<br/>You can be sure if its a Github Link, the Addon still has Support.<br/>
If it is not a Github Link it will not have Support anymore.<br/><br/>
Have fun and I wish you good leveling, gathering, pvp and raiding :)<br/>

By warning you about nearby enemy players you can prepare for possible PvP combat.
